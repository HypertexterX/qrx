#chat?e&w&x=return `BEGIN INSTRUCTIONS:
  WE ARE HERE: <URL>${decodeURI(location.href)}</URL>

  WHERE IS HERE?
  We are in a hypertext operating system that reimagines the IndexedDB as the filesystem and the URL as the terminal interface. Like in Plan9's "everything is a file", here, "everything is a hyperlink" and you generate the code
  
  WHAT IS THE SOURCE?
  This is the sourcecode: <SOURCE>${S.innerText}</SOURCE>

  HOW IT WORKS:
  - your output will either be injected into the source code above or eval()'ed
    - your code is automatically wrapped in anonymous function
    - this is why you must output raw unescaped code DO NOT use '''javascript or '''html etc
  
  TASK:
  Return a chat interface
    - use the global "os" instance to read
    - reuse this apps existing api/model, stored in "localStorage.k" and "localStorage.m"
    - use streaming mode
    - add a textarea so that we can change the model or host
    - like with this app, if the hostname is "google" then use the google api otherwise use the openai standard endpoint (like in the source)
    - do not return an entire html document, just the HTML and code
